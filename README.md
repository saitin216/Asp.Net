# Asp.Net
Rio Olympics Project

The Olympics website which is made using Asp.net, C# is a simple website which provides the details of the biggest sports event on Earth.
As there are so many games and sports take place during the Olympics, the information is the key to a viewer like which event takes place at which time, who plays for what country, etc. 
The information needed for the viewers can be accessed through a website which has all the info separated by the modules. It makes the task easy for the viewer to know about the dates of the games and the audience can even book the tickets if necessary.
